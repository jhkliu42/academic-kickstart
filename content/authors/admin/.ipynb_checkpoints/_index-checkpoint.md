I am a PhD student in the physics department at UC Berkeley studying the biophysics of gene regulatory networks. My research combines tools from synthetic biology, theoretical physics, and statistical inference to understand deep principles of biology, often at a systems-level scale. Although my background is in traditional physics, I have picked up a lot of familiarity with biology along the way and often inhabit the border between physics and biology, as well as between theory and experiment.

After graduating from Caltech with a B.S. in applied physics, I spent a year doing biophysics research with Prof. Dieter Braun at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Fulbright Student Fellowship. Iâ€™m currently in my fifth year at Berkeley and am working with Prof. Hernan Garcia in studying nonequilibrium processes in gene regulatory networks, in the context of developmental biology.

In addition to enjoying research, I am deeply committed to effective technical communication and scientific community building. I have given numerous successful talks to wide range of audiences, both expert and nonexpert, and regularly write scientific articles for the Berkeley Science Review. I am also involved in organizing various seminars in the UC Berkeley network and have taught multiple courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. For the past few years, I have also been involved with industry-academia connections, serving on the team of Beyond Academia, a student-run organization at UC Berkeley that brings together hundreds of PhDs in industry every year.

Outside of science, I am an active collaborative pianist in the Bay Area affiliated with the UC Berkeley Chamber Chorus. In my free time I enjoy reading speculative fiction, running, and cooking.
